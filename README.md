# M17_Reflectors
A place for the source code of all my M17 Reflector experiments.

The files in the python folder contain my first attempt at an M17 Reflector. Its honestly very junky and flawed. 

The files in the micropython folder were my second attempt and also had the plus of being runnable on an ESP32 running micropython. 

I plan on adding a C version to this project once I have some progress. It will be designed to run on an ESP32 as well.
